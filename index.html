					<h2>About me</h2>

					<p>Hi, my name is Nur Izfazulya Dzulkefli (you may call me Zulya!). I am a graduate from Yoobee School of Design with a diploma in Graphic Design. I am Malaysian though I have lived in New Zealand, Malaysia, and Indonesia with New Zealand being the longest time I’ve lived in. Because of the time I’ve spent overseas I understand how this industry differentiates in terms of quality, technology and the appropriateness it is to different groups of people. I am looking forward to studying a short course in Web Development soon so I have a better understanding of HTML as to broaden my skills to this digitally expanding industry. My interests are typically in design leaning more towards packaging and forms of digital design (that I have yet still to learn), and exploring how it appeals to different target audiences in terms of aesthetic and theory. I also have a passion for the enviornment, animals and a bit of gaming...</p>

					<h2>Skills</h2>

					<p>English is my first language although I can understand most Malaysian and Indonesian. I am good at listening to people and following up on tasks according to their importance. I have worked well as a team member for group projects in school, providing work where and when its needed and to ask questions where appropriate to the team leader. A recent project we did at Yoobee was a campaign for an ice cream company called Penguino. As a team we identified problems with the business and set ourselves individual tasks. I was to prepare and write up the proposal and I handled it well making it concise and clear while my team supplied me with data and other information they gathered about the business. The proposal was completed on time and in a quality standard making me the reliable choice for the task. Our team had gotten second place for the best proposal which was decided by the business owners themselves. I am a punctual person, if I do happen to be running late I will notify any persons who will be affected by it immediately.  I am organised, I keep my files and sketches named accordingly and grouped with all other related material to that brief or subject. I am able to lead a team when needed as well as following instructions from a client or another colleague. I am also great at working independently, asking questions only when needed.</p>
